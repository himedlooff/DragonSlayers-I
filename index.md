# The Mission

We want to have a good family of clans, **a clan network**, where members of all ages and levels who are **loyal**, **friendly**, and **nice** can play **together**.  All members will be treated with respect.  We want to provide clans with the appropriate troop strength and activeness for all members.  Friends from higher level clans can move down to help lower level friends.  Friends from lower level clans can move up for a short time to get good troops and visit friends from high level clans.  Friendships formed through Clash-of-Clans are easily maintained when friends move up within our clan network.  Leaders and elders will move among the clans to foster the camaraderie among clan members.

# The Clans

**THE CURRENT 4 CLANS:** DragonSlayers-I, [DragonSlayersJr](http://bit.ly/dragonslayersjr), DragonSlayerJR, SlayersVacation

**DragonSlayers-I:** Our main clan for level 70+ or all Tier I & II troops level 4.  During the growing phase of this clan, the minimum donation will be based on the number of members in the clan.

# Clan War Strategy

*(I am putting together something quick to help us out.  I hope that with your help, over time, we will improve this Clan War Strategy section.)*

Remember to have **FUN**.  This is a game, so just try to have fun and go with the flow.  No stress.

**Suggestions for preparing your base:**

1. Move your townhall behind the walls during the preparation day.  Suggestion, to create a base with the inner core of 7x8, 8x8 or larger so that you can quickly convert between trophy base and farming base.
2. Request troops that are both good for defense and offense like dragon, wizards, lvl 4+ minions, lvl 5+ archers.
3. Train good attack troops for yourself and for donation. 
4. Make sure your heros and your spells are ready.

**Suggestions for clan attacking strategy:**

1. The goal is to gain stars, just like in single player campaign.
2. Try to fight the enemy base that not yet been raid by anyone of us.  It is easier to gain 1 star from 0 star than to improve from 1 star base to 2 stars, or 2 stars to 3 stars
3. Uncharted and Ammjr suggest that we should take our top level members to fight against their 2nd levels members, our 2nd levels fight against their 3rd levels, and our 3rd levels fight against their top levels.  For example our #1 player fight agains their #10 townhall, our #2 players fight against their #11 townhall, etc...
4. We should have members with weakest troops start the fight first.  And we should start from the enemy weakest base and work our way up.

**Important distinction when talk about strength/ranking level:**

1. The bases in the war zone is ranked based on defense capability
2. The attacker strength is based on the level of the troops the attacker can train.
3. For example: base like that of Eagles, who have a max out TH8 and just upgrade to TH9 do not have lvl6 troops.  Eagles' base is ranked 13, but his attack strength may not be as high.  The point is that we should try to communicate with each other, understand all members troop strength and coordinate our attack.

**Screen Capture Enemy War Bases**

In the future, I would like to be able to put up enemy bases on Google drive or dropbox, and share it with our members regarding attacking strategy, type of troops to use, etc.  Does anyone have a section of Google drive or dropbox that you want to use for this purpose?

**INFORMATION ON CLANS DEVELOPMENT:** 

**Formation of DragonSlayers clan network:** We have completed stage 1 and are currently executing **Stage 2**.

**Stage 1:** The formation of **DragonSlayers-I** (Stage 1 COMPLETED)

REMEMBER that **DragonSlayersJr** is still our **main clan** at this early stage


**Stage 2:** Growing both **DragonSlayers-I** and **DragonSlayersJr**

1. Elders from both clans will recruit members and send new members to the appropriate clans
2. Elders accept the new members based on level, friend-in-need status, know the exception parameters for your clan.  
3. When members with lower level than expected get into our clan and are not willing to move to the "lower" clan, we will let them stay for awhile then the leader will "kick" them with the message of asking them to join the appropriate clan.

**Stage 3:** Reaching stability for both clans, **DragonSlayers-I** & **DragonSlayersJr**, and the creation of **DragonSlayers-II**

1. If things are going well for both clan, in 1-2 months we should reach 35 stable members in **DragonSlayers-I** and 45 members in **DragonSlayersJr**
2. As DragonSlayersJr growing and reaching 45 members, we will slowly, one by one move qualify active elders to DragonSlayers-I
3. Qualified elders from **DragonSlayerJR** will be promoted to **DragonSlayersJr**

**Future Expansion of the DragonSlayers clan network**

**Stage 4:** The Creation of DragonSlayers-III

# The Mission

We want to have a good family of clans, **a clan network**, where members of all ages and levels who are **loyal**, **friendly**, and **nice** can play **together**.  All members will be treated with respect.  We want to provide clans with the appropriate troop strength and activeness for all members.  Friends from higher level clans can move down to help lower level friends.  Friends from lower level clans can move up for a short time to get good troops and visit friends from high level clans.  Friendships formed through Clash-of-Clans are easily maintained when friends move up within our clan network.  Leaders and elders will move among the clans to foster the camaraderie among clan members.

# The Clans

**THE CURRENT 4 CLANS:** DragonSlayers-I, [DragonSlayersJr](http://bit.ly/dragonslayersjr), DragonSlayerJR, SlayersVacation

**DragonSlayers-I:** Our most active clan for level 70+ or all Tier I & II troops level 4.
